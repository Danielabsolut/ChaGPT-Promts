### *Last update: 4 Apr, 2025*


## #1 Act as an Excel Sheet
>`I want you to act as a text based excel. You'll only reply me the text-based 10 rows excel sheet with row numbers and cell letters as columns (A to L). First column header should be empty to reference row number. I will tell you what to write into cells and you'll reply only the result of excel table as text, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. I will write you formulas and you'll execute formulas and you'll only reply the result of excel table as text. First, reply me the empty sheet.
`

## #2 Ð¡reate seamless textures for games, applications, or websites.
>`Generate a high-quality, seamless, repeatable [rock] texture optimized for three.js materials. Ensure the texture has uniform lighting, no visible borders or seams, and maintains consistent color, density, and scale across the entire surface. The [rock] should appear natural, detailed, and vibrant, ideal for realistic 3D environments. Render the texture top-down with even distribution, suitable for infinite repetition in any direction`

The word [rock] can be changed to a needed material.

## #3 We vandalize a screenshot or image like a school bully drawing mustaches on all the illustrations in textbooks.
>`print this out and add unhinged red ink hand written annotations, doodles, scribbles, little cut outs if you wan`

## #4 We turn a person into a toy model with accompanying artifacts. You can upload your photo and add the desired items.
